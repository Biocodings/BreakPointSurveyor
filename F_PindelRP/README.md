# PindelRP

*Process Pindel Read Pair (RP) breakpoint predictions*

Here, for now, performing two steps:

1. Copy Pindel output files generated in previous runs and make list of them
2. Create BPR files which indicate regions where breakpoints detected by Pindel.

**TODO**: Implement Pindel runs based on examples here:
* `/gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/Virus/Virus_2013.9a/analysis/UnifiedVirus2/W_PostIntegrationList/I_Pindel`
* `/gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/Virus/Virus_2013.9a/analysis/discordant_pair/Sweep/B_Pindel`
