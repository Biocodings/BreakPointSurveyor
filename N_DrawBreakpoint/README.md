# DrawBreakpoint

*Plot breakpoint coordinates from various predictors to breakpoint panel GGP.*

Create a Breakpoint Panel (the upper right panel in BPS Structure plot), which illustrates
positions of breakpoints on an X,Y plane.

1. **Draw Pindel predictions**.  Create GGP file with regions (rectangles) corresponding to 
   Pindel RP predictions
2. **Draw Discordant predictions**.  Draw a point corresponding to location of discordant read.
3. **Draw Contig predictions** Draw a + symbol corresponding to Contig prediction.

Steps 2 and 3 read in GGP file generated by previous step, add a layer visualizing the data
being plotted and save the new GGP file.  Additional tools can be added here in an analogous
way.

We create dat/GGP as a link to the output directory of the most recent GGP step
as a convenience for downstream stages.

By definition, here chrom A and B correspond to X and Y axes, resp.  Also by
definition of BPC/BPR data, `chrom a < chrom b`.  By default, chrom a = chrom A
and chrom b = chrom B, but this can be changed with `FLIP_AB` parameter defined
in `../bps.config`.  This allows control chrom/virus axes.
