Integration occurs in an intronic section of gene *RAD51B* and copy number
changes are coincident with breakpoints.

## Interpretation
<img src="../doc/StructurePlotChimeric.png" width="600"/>

Breakpoints are observed to co-occur with copy number changes, and two-peaked
distribution in the histogram of viral read depth may indicate multiple viral
populations.  Such patterns are consistent with extrachromosomal human-virus
episomes.  See manuscript for details.
