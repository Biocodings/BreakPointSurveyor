The aim of this directory is to generate TCGA_SARC.samples.dat,  a canonical list of samples 
with paths to primary data sources.

Currently bam paths and paths to variant calls are listed.  Additional data sources can be incorporated into this file.

Work in this directory is TCGA-SARC and MGI-Specific

Workflow:

1) Get list of all "Dedifferentiated liposarcoma" tumor WGS samples 
  * Based on McLellan's work here: /gscuser/mmclella/shared/TCGA_SARC/Samples/WGS_Selection/Selection3

2) Get sample BAM paths

3) Obtain paths to variant calls based on somatic variation builds.
    The model group ID of interest is, 49b5bfdec8d84b79946640611892fa17
    Duplicates have been found to occur.  It is up to the user to remove duplicates.

4) merge BAM and variant paths into a unified data file TCGA_SARC.samples.dat.  Subsequent processing
   steps will refer to this file for further processing.
