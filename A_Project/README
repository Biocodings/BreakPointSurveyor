Analysis of preliminary 1000SV Pindel and Breakdancer calls

Jay 2/2/16
The high-coverage CRAMs and converted BAMs for the nine samples are under
    /gscmnt/gc2500/dinglab/1000G_svtrio/data_collections/hgsv_sv_discovery/*/high_cov_alignment/
Reference files are under

My local pindel results are available here to help you with developing your methods until Kai can provide (albeit perhaps with different parameters):
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/pindel/group0/pindel.out.group0.raw
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/pindel/group0/pindel.out.group0.current_final.gvip.denovo.vcf
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/pindel/group1/pindel.out.group1.raw
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/pindel/group1/pindel.out.group1.current_final.gvip.denovo.vcf
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/pindel/group2/pindel.out.group2.raw
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/pindel/group2/pindel.out.group2.current_final.gvip.denovo.vcf

I checked the FTP site; these high-coverage data are advertised as WGS and aligned to GRCh38.
You should be able to access the BAMs from the links in /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/genomes
My BreakDancer calls are in
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/breakdancer/breakdancer/group*/{ITX,CTX}/*triofilter_pass
where calls were deemed to have passed if there were supporting reads from child only.

These are the pindel read pairs with support in the child only:
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/pindel/group0/merged_RP.raw.child_only
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/pindel/group1/merged_RP.raw.child_only
    /gscmnt/gc2510/dinglab/rmashl/1000g_svtrios_runs/pindel/pindel/group2/merged_RP.raw.child_only
These were derived from the files "merged_RP.raw" in the same directories.
