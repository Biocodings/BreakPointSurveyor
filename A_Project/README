MGI-Specific


Getting list of all "Dedifferentiated liposarcoma" tumor WGS samples.
-> This yields reference alignment models, which are not what we want
    Work based on McLellan's work here:
        /gscuser/mmclella/shared/TCGA_SARC/Samples/WGS_Selection/Selection3
    and 
        /gscuser/mmclella/shared/TCGA_SARC/Samples/Clinical/2014-12-17

    List generated in step 2 of all available samples is identical to McLellan's in the directory above.

Based on Mike's email 11/3/15, we really want somatic variation builds, which incorporate SV detection.
    The model group ID of interest is, 49b5bfdec8d84b79946640611892fa17
    This is done in step 4 and written to dat/SARC_DDLS.somatic_variation.dat
