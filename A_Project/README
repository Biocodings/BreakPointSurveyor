Create here TCGA_Virus.SampleList.dat, which contains the following fields for each sample of interest,
* Barcode - unique identifier
* BAM_path - path to BAM file realigned to human + virus reference
* REF_path - path to reference FASTA the BAM is aligned to
* SAM_path - path to SAM file containing discordant reads
* disease - TCGA code of cancer type

We will evaluate the following five samples,
* BA-4077 chr 14 

Here, we construct the SampleList.dat incrementally, with several files with Barcode/Data merged
together at the end.  This is to simulate how SampleList would be constructed with data from 
other upstream analyses (e.g., alignment)
