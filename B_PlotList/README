Obtaining inter-chromosomal translocation positions from somatic variant pipeline.

Per Mike McLellan email 12/1/15, inter-chromosomal positions are identified as CTX in the 
variants/svs.hq file.

Constructing two types of files in step 1, BPC and dBPC.  See below for more details:

BPC files are used later for plotting, while dBPC are used for making BED files.

Constructing BED files of SV events:
Simply taking all dBPC positions into one BED file results in a large (1000+ lines) BED file which takes a very long
    time to process (days).
Instead, we will cluster breakpoints by a given radius to create a clustered BPR file.

We then create a PlotList from BPR directly.  There is then one plot (and two read depth calculations) per line of 
PlotList file.
