Plot CTX breakpoint coordinates.

Note that if we want to plot other breakpoint coordinates or regions from
other lines of evidence (Pindel, for instance), this will be done in
a different directory.  For instance, P_Pindel directory may add Pindel
marks to both breakpoint coordinate as well as read depth plots.
