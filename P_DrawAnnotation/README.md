# P_DrawAnnotation
*Create annotation panel GGP showing genes and exons*

Exons and genes are represented as [BED](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html) files in
[B_ExonGene](../B_ExonGene/README.md).  See
[`AnnotationDrawer.R`](https://github.com/ding-lab/BreakPointSurveyor-Core/blob/master/src/plot/AnnotationDrawer.R)
for details.  The [`Synthetic` branch](https://github.com/ding-lab/BreakPointSurveyor/tree/Synthetic) demonstrates various
annotation functionality, including labeling of exons.

See [N_DrawBreakpoint](../N_DrawBreakpoint/README.md) and the [developer guide](../Development.md) for general details about plotting.
