# DrawAnnotation
*Create annotation panel GGP showing genes and exons*

Exons and genes are represented as [BED](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html) files in
[B_ExonGene](../B_ExonGene/README.md).  See
[`AnnotationDrawer.R`](https://github.com/ding-lab/BreakPointSurveyor-Core/blob/master/src/plot/AnnotationDrawer.R)
for details.  The [`Synthetic` branch](https://github.com/ding-lab/BreakPointSurveyor/tree/Synthetic) demonstrates various
annotation functionality, including labeling of exons.

See
[N_DrawBreakpoint](https://github.com/ding-lab/BreakPointSurveyor/tree/master/N_DrawBreakpoint)
and the [developer
guide](https://github.com/ding-lab/BreakPointSurveyor/blob/master/Development.md)
for general details about plotting.
