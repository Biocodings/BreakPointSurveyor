Development of pysam-based version of depthFilter.py. Based on previous version
    /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/Virus/Virus_2013.9a/analysis/UnifiedVirus2/Q_BreakpointSurvey.PBP/src/depthFilter.py
but uses pysam, which is significantly faster.  Current code in ../src/depthFilter.py

Background:
    Prior pysam work:
        /gscmnt/gc7210/dinglab/medseq/maw/Virus/Virus_2013.9a/analysis/UnifiedVirus2/U_SAMBreakpoints/src/SAMReader.py

    Note that for CRAM read functionality require vesion 8.2 and newer.  We have old version:
        pip freeze | grep pysam
        pysam==0.7.8

    /opt/flow-python2.7/bin/pip install --user pysam --upgrade
    This works:
        ~$ /opt/flow-python2.7/bin/python
            Python 2.7.3 (default, Mar 26 2013, 15:58:06)
            [GCC 4.4.3] on linux2
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
            >>> import pysam
            >>> pysam.__version__
            '0.8.4'
    Note, need to run python 2.7 with /opt/flow-python2.7/bin/python or /usr/bin/python2.7

    Pysam Documentation: http://pysam.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#
        Note that as of early Feb 2016 pysam 0.8.5 is out, we have 0.8.4 installed.  Should be OK.

Testing:
    For testing purposes, we'll evaluate depth for ICGC sample from /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/TCGA_SARC/C_ReadDepth/DEPTH,
        TCGA-DX-A1KW-01A-22D-A24N-09_50K_depth.fromBPR.dat

    Current version of depthFilter.py may be off by one or two basepairs in position as compared to `samtools depth`
