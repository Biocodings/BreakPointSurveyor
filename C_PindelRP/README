Here, for now, performing two steps:
1. construct list of Pindel output files from 
    /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/Virus/Virus_2013.9a/analysis/discordant_pair/Sweep/B_Pindel
   and related processing.  For now, just copy them here
2. Create BPR files which indicate regions where breakpoints detected by Pindel.

TODO: Implement Pindel runs from,
    /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/Virus/Virus_2013.9a/analysis/UnifiedVirus2/W_PostIntegrationList/I_Pindel
    /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/Virus/Virus_2013.9a/analysis/discordant_pair/Sweep/B_Pindel
