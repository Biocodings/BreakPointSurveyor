Obtaining inter-chromosomal translocation positions from somatic variant pipeline.

Per Mike McLellan email 12/1/15, inter-chromosomal positions are identified as CTX in the 
variants/svs.hq file.

Constructing two types of files in step 1, BPC and dBPC.  See below for more details:
    /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/TCGA_SARC/ICGC/A_AnalyzeVCF/README
BPC files are used later for plotting, while dBPC are used for making BED files.

Constructing BED files of SV events:
Simply taking all dBPC positions into one BED file results in a large (1000+ lines) BED file which takes a very long
    time to process (days).
Instead, we will cluster breakpoints by a given radius to create a clustered BPR file.

We then create a PlotList from BPR directly.  There is then one plot (and two read depth calculations) per line of 
PlotList file.

TODO:
* indicate these are CTX files

Summary
1) get list of "dedifferentiated liposarcoma" WGS samples and their corresponding MGI somatic variation model IDs
2) Obtain interchromosomal translocation positions (CTX) from MGI pipeline. Create BPC file per sample of CTX coordinates
3) Cluster all breakpoints into breakpoint regions with script makeBreakpointRegions.py.  This creates per-sample BPR file
4) Prioritize clusters based on number of CTX breakpoints with cluster
5) Create PlotList file from prioritized CTX breakpoint clusters
