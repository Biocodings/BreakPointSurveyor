Workflow Architecture 

A_Project - contains most locale and project-specific information, e.g. paths to primary data, sample IDs

B_CTX,... - Various SV predictions and other evidence based on primary data.  Independent of PlotList

G_PlotList - Defines regions of interest / plot ranges based on upstream discovery

H_Depth,... - PlotList-driven analyses of primary data

M_Reference - Reference-specific and other static data not specific to project.  Data
    for selected reference distributed with project.  Optional.

N_RenderBreakpoint, O_RenderDepth, P_RenderAnnotation, Q_RenderHistogram - Create GGP objects
    which correspond to particular panels in combined BPS plot.  These and sebsequent steps 
    rely only on secondary data generated in steps B-M.

W_Assemble - Create composite PDF figure based on GGP objects.
