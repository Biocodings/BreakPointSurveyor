Analyze expression in vicinity of integration events.

This analysis proceeds in three steps:
1) Create BED files which indicate regions of interest for each disease type
2) Analyze RNA-Seq data for both cases (sample with integration event in given region)
   and controls (all other samples with same cancer type as case).  This analysis 
   is performed by VirusScan (confirm) and not included here.
3) Evaluate expression of case exons vs. control, and combine to obtain per-gene p-value
   of case expression disregulation.
