Analyze expression in vicinity of integration events.

This analysis proceeds in three steps:
1) Create BED files which indicate regions of interest for each disease type
2) Analyze RNA-Seq data for both cases (sample with integration event in given region)
   and controls (all other samples with same cancer type as case).  This analysis 
   is performed by VirusScan (confirm) and not included here.
3) Evaluate expression of case exons vs. control, and combine to obtain per-gene p-value
   of case expression disregulation.


*** step 2 *** clean up discussion

We want to evaluate the RNA expression of exons in the vicinity of integration events.  For each case (sample with integration event at
a known genomic location) we compare RPKM expression of controls (tumor samples of same disease) versus the case for exons near the case integration
location.  This proceeds as follows.
0. Given location of integration events for all controls, Song created RPKM expression data for nearby exons for all cases.
   (note that cases are lumped in with controls here).
1. For each disease, combine expression of all controls into one master file.  The master file has a format similar to that obtained
   from firehose RSEM data, with columns representing case samples and rows representing exons.  This is perfomed by the
   script 3_create_rpkm_master_datafile.sh
2. Separate master file into per-case files.  For every sample with integration event (case), extract rows corresponding to exons
   near the integration event into a file named after the case.  Note that there may be more than one integration event per
   case, and that the case barcode will appear in the column headers together with all the controls.

Understanding coverageBed
     After each entry in B, reports:
       1) The number of features in A that overlapped the B interval.
       2) The number of bases in B that had non-zero coverage.
       3) The length of the entry in B.
       4) The fraction of bases in B that had non-zero coverage.

formula for RPKM,
  1256 (number mapped reads) * 1KM * / (3151 * mapped reads)
  = 1256 * 1000000000 / (3151 * 108470532)
