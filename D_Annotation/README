This directory contains gene and exon definitions based on Ensembl release 75 which are
used for gene/exon annotation plots, as well as a workflow to recreate it for other Ensembl versions.
This workflow is necessary only if gene/exon definitions need to be recreated for other Ensembl
versions.

dat/genes.ens75.bed contains gene definitions
dat/exons.ens75.bed contains exon definitions

GTF file from ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf.gz

Workflow parses Ensemble GTF file directly to pull out genes and exons.  Details of the selection process
are in GTFFilter.py.  Specifically, to call a feature a gene or exon we require the 
following values for GTF columns:
    Genes: feature = "gene" and source = "protein_coding"
    Exons: feature = "exon" and source = "protein_coding"

We also provide a script called src/TLAExamine.R (see 3_examine_GTF.sh)
which conveniently examines GTF files by expanding the attributes column into
multiple columns.

1_get_merged_exon_bed.sh and 2_get_gene_bed.sh are production scripts which extract genes and exons
    from GTF file.  These need to be run just once and then the resulting features file can be used
    for downstream applications.
    -> dat/exons.ens75.bed
    -> dat/genes.ens75.bed
3_examine_GTF.sh and 4_make_gtf_test.sh are test scripts and are not used for production
