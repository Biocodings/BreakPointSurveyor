# BPS_DATA points to data directory.  Defining `BPS_DATA=".."` (the default)
# will write the data from a given stage (e.g., A_Project) into a data directory 
# in that stage.  Alternatively, can define BPS_DATA to point to a separate directory 
# tree, which allows the Workflow and Data layers to be independently located.

# In the assembled plot, chrom positions A and B correspond to x, y coordinates, respectively.
# By default, chrom A < chrom B (by string comparison), as in BPC/BPR files.
# This order can be switched by setting FLIPAB=1 (by default, FLIPAB=0)
# Note that this option will need to be defined consistently in any steps which process BPC/BPR files
