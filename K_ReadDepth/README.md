# ReadDepth

*Evaluate read depth in target regions, obtain BAM file statistics for both WGS and RNA-Seq data*

Evaluate read depth in region of interest around each integration event.
We will not evaluate read depth for normalization purposes because the custom reference will
make calculations meaningless
