Step 1:
    Extract from BAMs all virus reads and human->virus paired-end discordant reads
    Two files are created for each BAM:
    * virus_XXX.sam - has all reads which contain a virus
    * discordant_XXX.sam - subset of above which has just reads which map to human whose mate maps to virus
    This step can be time consuming, so support provided for cluster queuing system (bsub)

Step 2: 
    Create BPC (breakpoint coordinates) file which lists human-virus discordant reads
    This is written to dat/BPC/XXX_Discordant.BPC.dat
